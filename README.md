POCs written in Rust
====================

Right now, the only available POC is `structured_concurrency`.

`structured_concurrency` is adapted from the [Rust Book final project][], but has a few
differences. Notably, it uses the structured concurrency paradigm.

There is more information in its dedicated [README](./structured_concurrency/README.md) file.
